Learning Project â€“ Python Backend and DevOps

This repository is a personal learning project focused on developing a small full-stack web application to explore backend development with Python (Flask) and DevOps workflows.


Purpose

The main goal is to understand how to design, build, and deploy a backend system while gaining practical experience with modern development tools and practices.
Key learning areas include:

Building a RESTful API using Flask and Python.

Connecting a backend to a database (PostgreSQL).

Structuring a frontend (React) to interact with the backend.

Applying DevOps concepts such as containerization, CI/CD, and cloud deployment.

Technologies

Backend: Python (Flask)

Frontend: React (Vite)

Database: PostgreSQL

DevOps Tools: Docker (planned), GitHub Actions (planned)

Version Control: Git and GitHub

Current Status

Currently working on the frontend structure and preparing to integrate a Flask backend.
The long-term goal is to containerize and deploy the application to a cloud environment as part of learning DevOps workflows.

Notes

This project is for educational purposes, with an emphasis on learning DevOps practices, backend programming in Python, and the process of connecting and deploying a full-stack system.
